# Chemical Bonds

This game was made as an interactive trivia experience to make learning about chemistry and the periodic table more exciting. The game takes you along with six different students, each with unique weaknesses that need to be addressed (aside from Brent).

The game is built using the Pico8 fantasy console and is written in Lua.

You can play the game for free on my [itch.io page](https://chimefever.itch.io/chemical-bonds)!
